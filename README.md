# Food Delivery Website - First College Mini Project

Welcome to the repository for our first-year college group mini project - a Food Delivery Website! üçîüçïüöö

## Project Overview

During our first year in college, we embarked on a journey to create a simple food delivery website. At that time, version control was a new concept for us, so we're sharing the code directly on GitHub to showcase our early work and progress. Please keep in mind that this project was developed as part of our learning experience, and there might be areas that could be improved and modernized.
